Scripts to setup test virtual machines for learning ansible.
Some scripts refer to files intentionally not included located just above the project's folder called secretfiles.
Within that filder are folders for each user.  I did this instead of using the ansible vault mostly because I don't want to enter the vault password each time I run this.  
Maybe when I finish I'll change my mind about not using the ansible vault, but for now I'm going save myself step of entering pw every time I run this.
